# Machine-Learning-Python
Machine learning A-Z Udemy course for a first approach to the different algorithms. 
For this repository we study the following  algorithms:

### Regression
- Pre-processing data
- Simple linear regression
- Multiple linear regression
- Polynomial regression
- Support vector regression (SVR)
- Decision tree regression
- Random Forest Regression

### Classification
- Logistic regression
- K-Nearest neighbors (K-NN)
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision tree classification
- Random forest classification

### Clustering
